# Take input of weights of 11 people and 
# then print their average and then check whether the average weight 
# is a multiple of 5 or not? This means that when you will divide the average weight by 5, 
# the remainder should be 0.

# Note :-
# Here you have to use input function.
#  You can also use raw input to take the weights as inputs, inside the loop.

# i=0
# weight_total=0
# while i<11:
#     weight=int(input("Enter the numbers:"))
#     i+=1
#     weight_total=weight_total+weight
# print(weight_total)
# average=weight_total/11
# print(average)
# if average%5==0:
#     print("Multiple of 5")
# else:
#     print("not a multiple of 5")
